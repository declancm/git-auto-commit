# git-commit-vim
A vim/neovim shell script and keymap for linux that allows for automatic git commiting and pushing to an external repository (that has already been initialized).

## Dependencies:
- git
- vim/neovim

## Installation:
- Add the git.sh script to '~/.' for vim, or to '~/.config/nvim/. for neovim.' This can be customized by changing the calling path in the keymap.
- Add either the vim keymap to your '~/.vimrc' or the neovim keymap to your '~/.config/nvim/init.vim'.
- Initialize the external repo for your git repository.
